# Contribution guidelines CLTL website

CLTL members can directly update personal content, keeping in mind the editorial guidelines below. Other contributions can be made through pull requests and by posting issues.


## Technical content management
This website is written with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). Page content is written in html under `./templates`. Static content like images is stored under `./static`. See the [README](README.md#deploying-the-website-locally) for instructions on deploying the website locally before pushing changes.

## Editorial guidelines
This repository is set up to accept changes through pull requests, but CLTL members are free to bypass branch protection. Please consider ahead of time what is the goal of your contribution: small changes can be made directly; more involving changes should be discussed with the editorial team, but the discussion can be helped/shortened by a pull request. In summary:

1. **Correcting errors**: broken links, typos, etc. can be fixed directly without prior discussion
2. **Updating personal information**: idem
3. **Adding / revising page content**: get in touch with the editorial team first and/or make a pull request with the proposed change
4. Revising the **structure of the website and content organisation**: get in touch with the editorial team to set up a meeting
5. Revising the **look of the website**: get in touch with the editorial team and/or make a pull request

## Editorial team
The editorial team is a very fine selection of CLTL members that enjoys special consideration within the group. The team is very inclusive and welcomes other CLTL members, also for short periods.
