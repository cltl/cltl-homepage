<h3>Research Master Human Language Technology</h3>



<div>



    <p>
        Language technology is rapidly affecting society at large. 
        The Human Language Technology (HLT) track of the Research Master Linguistics is 2-year program for excellent students interested in research.
        It brings together students from various backgrounds to study Machine Learning methods for Natural Language Processing in relation to linguistics and the Humanities.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Students finish the program by writing a master's thesis, which can be carried out in our research group or as part of an internship with a company.
        The CLTL actively looks for partnering companies to provide internship topics.
        Students often find a PhD position or a job in the language technology industry.
        Have a look at our <a href="{{ url_for('education_theses') }}">theses archive</a> for an overview of previous topics.
