    <p>
        Language technology is rapidly affecting society at large. 
        In the Language and AI track of the MA Linguistics, students from various 
        backgrounds (Linguistics, AI, but also other disciplines) come together 
        to study Machine Learning methods and Linguistics for Natural Language Processing.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Students finish the program by carrying out an internship in a company or in our research group
        for their final thesis project. The CLTL actively looks for <a href="{{ url_for('education_overview') }}#internships">partnering companies</a>
        to provide internship topics. 
        The industry provides many career opportunities, as there is a growing need for linguists with a technical background.
        Past their internship, students often find a research position in their internship company .
