    <p>
        Companies have an increasing need of language technology specialists to deal with the rapid digitization of today's society.
        In the Language and AI track of our Master's program in Linguistics, students from various backgrounds
        (Linguistics, AI, but also other disciplines) come together  to study Machine Learning methods and Linguistics for Natural Language Processing.
        This is a 1-year program targeted at students who want a faster track to an industry job.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Students finish the program by writing a thesis. The thesis is often carried out as part of an internship, but it can  also be completed on a research topic in consultation with our research group.
        The CLTL actively looks for partnering companies to provide internship topics.
        Upon completing this program, most of our students find an industry position as an NLP or Language Data specialist.
